## Technologies Used

Our front-end is powered by modern tools and libraries to ensure a smooth, efficient, and intuitive user experience:

- **Frameworks:**

  - `Zustand` - Manages global application state, such as user authentication, challenges data, and notifications.

- **HTTP Requests:**

  - `Axios` - Handles API communication with the back-end server.

- **Styling and CSS Frameworks:**

  - `Tailwind CSS` - A utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern UI design.

- **Development and Build Tools:**
  - `Vite` - A fast front-end build tool for a streamlined development experience.
  - `ESLint` - Ensures consistent and clean code through linting.
  - `Prettier` - Formats code automatically for readability and uniformity.
